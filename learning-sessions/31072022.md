## What I have learnt today
- C# equivalent for Console.Readkey() is fmt.Scan()
- Becoming more use to the syntax with printing out to the console, converting one type to another and using the declaration and initialisation way instead of defining and then initialising.
- Probably the hardest kata I've done, going to have to go and do some research to see if I can find a solution to the timing out.
