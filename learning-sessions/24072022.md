## What I have learnt today
- The is a concept of slices, in which you delcare the range of length that variable can have.
  - Learned how to use the append function to create a new slice  with a dynamic length.
- Learned how to debug Go with VS code.
- Learned about struct's to define a 'type'. Used it as a key pair value and the solution object for sumofperfectsquares.
- Practised importing from another module to set up the structure of me completing kata's on codewars.

## Things to work on
- Look into declaring and initialising a new variable with type, think I'm doing it incorrectly - could be wrong just doesn't feel "clean".
- Finish the "sum of perfect squares" kata solution
- Look into unit testing within Go, to write my own test cases for the kata's.
